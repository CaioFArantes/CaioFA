## Projects of Data Analysis using Python
Here is a brief description of the projects that I am currently working and studying using Python language.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
### LIST OF PROJECTS:
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### 1) Fictional DB - Real Estate - Apartments for Rent in Rio de Janeiro
##### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

* This is a project where I simulate a DB from a Real Estate company. 
* The DB has different types of properties for rent (apartments, houses, farms, ranchs...)
* During the project I listed every step I took (including calculation, classification, statistics...); a brief analysis of the results, and also a problematization to solve.

* The steps were:
    
  <br>1) Clearing NaN values</br>
  <br>2) Clustering classification</br>
  <br>3) Brief calculation:</br>
  
    <br>3.1) What is the total volume of each available category?</br>
    <br>3.2) Finding the total Rent value (Rent + Condo Fee) and the Gross m¬≤ price - For the whole DB</br>
    <br>3.3) Finding the Net m¬≤ price (only considering Rent, not condo fee) - For the whole DB</br>
    <br>3.4) Condo fee per m¬≤ (absolute value and diff percentage(%) of rent) </br>
    

  <br>4) Questions to solve through analysis:</br>
  
   <br> 4.1) How many residential appartmanets I have in my database and what is the Mean value of them? How much can I have as a potential profit?</br>
   <br> 4.2) What are the Top 10 most valuable Neighbourhoods?</br>
   <br> 4.3) What is the mean price for each one?</br>
   <br> 4.4) What is the median size of the available appartments at these top 10 neighbourhoods?</br>
   <br> 4.5) What is the most frequent typology (number of rooms) in each neighborhood?</br>
   <br> 4.6) How many car spaces are more frequent in each neighborhood?</br>
