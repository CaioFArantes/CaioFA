PROJECT DESCRIPTION
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
  Project 1) Fictional DB - Real Estate - Apartments for Rent in Rio de Janeiro:

* This is a project where I simulate a DB from a Real Estate company. 
* The DB has different types of properties for rent (apartments, houses, farms, ranchs...)
* During the project I listed every step I took (including calculation, classification, statistics...); a brief analysis of the results, and also a problematization to solve.

  * The steps were:
    
  1) clearing NaN values
  2) Clustering classification
  3) Brief calculation:
  
    3.1) What is the total volume of each available category?
    3.2) Finding the total Rent value (Rent + Condo Fee) and the Gross m² price - For the whole DB
    3.3) Finding the Net m² price (only considering Rent, not condo fee) - For the whole DB
    3.4) Condo fee per m² (absolute value and diff percentage(%) of rent)

  4) Questions to solve through analysis:
  
    4.1) How many residential appartmanets I have in my database and what is the Mean value of them? How much can I have as a potential profit?
    4.2) What are the Top 10 most valuable Neighbourhoods?
    4.3) What is the mean price for each one?
    4.4) What is the median size of the available appartments at these top 10 neighbourhoods?
    4.5) What is the most frequent typology (number of rooms) in each neighborhood?
    4.6) How many car spaces are more frequent in each neighborhood?
