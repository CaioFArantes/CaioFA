PROJECT DESCRIPTION
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
  Project 1) Fictional DB - Real Estate - Apartments for Rent in Rio de Janeiro:

* This is a project where I simulate a DB from a Real Estate company. 
* The DB has different types of properties for rent (apartments, houses, farms, ranchs...)
* During the project I listed every step I took (including calculation, classification, statistics...); a brief analysis of the results, and also a problematization to solve.

  * The steps were:
    
  1) clearing NaN values
  2) Clustering classification
  *c) Brief calculation:
  
    *c.1) What is the total volume of each available category?
    *c.2) Finding the total Rent value (Rent + Condo Fee) and the Gross m² price - For the whole DB
    *c.3) Finding the Net m² price (only considering Rent, not condo fee) - For the whole DB
    *c.4) Condo fee per m² (absolute value and diff percentage(%) of rent)

  *d) Questions to solve through analysis:
  
    *d.1) How many residential appartmanets I have in my database and what is the Mean value of them? How much can I have as a potential profit?
    *d.2) What are the Top 10 most valuable Neighbourhoods?
    *d.3) What is the mean price for each one?
    *d.4) What is the median size of the available appartments at these top 10 neighbourhoods?
    *d.5) What is the most frequent typology (number of rooms) in each neighborhood?
    *d.6) How many car spaces are more frequent in each neighborhood?
